- Connect to suncalc or some other library/API that can do sunrise/sunset/moonphase
    - Current sunrise/sunset/moonrise appear inaccurate—should be fixed by switching source
- Get timezone to show up
- Speed up performance
    - Improve geolocation
        - Speed
        - Timeout/failure handling
        - Permissions request on all devices
        - Error handling
- Allow users to enter/select a location of their choice, not just where they are right now?
- Reduce number of decimals for lat/long
- Evolving gradient background
    - Light/dark icons according to what bg is displayed
    - Get sunrise, sunset
    - Solar noon right in the middle
    - Add "solar midnight", midpoint between sunset and sunrise
    - Add dawn (midpoint of midnight and sunrise) and dusk (midpoint of sunset and midnight)
    - Define gradients for these 6 points then interpolate between them
    - Render gradients with OKLCH (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/)
    - Add "cloudy" mode (desaturated, dull gradients)?
- Fix language issues in word time:
    - Some messy stuff around "thirteen", 
    - make sure noon/midnight appear when grammatically correct and revert to "twelve" otherwise
- Improve moon phase calculation (there are precise algos for that)
- Link to SunriseSunset.io (required for free API)
    - Possibly on about page?
- Maybe a toggle to switch between plain mode and sky mode—some folks will possibly prefer the typography-only approach.
    - Brutalism mode switch?
- Word handling for midnight—we can say "five to midnight" or "ten past midnight", right? We wouldn't necessarily do it for noon. So maybe a very edgy edge case?
    - On this, I'd like to be able to control what time it is for testing/screenshot purposes.
