THINGS TO DO:

- Â Ask for location
    - Ideally, also an input field/search bar that allows you to input any location
- Grab Date, time, city, long/lat, sunrise, sunset and moon phase from API
- innerHTML each of those elements
- update everything in real time? NO! Use RTC to keep date/time updated after initial API call
